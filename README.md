## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<a href="introduction">Introduction</a>

**Overview**

This project is a flexible authentication solution built with Next.js, NextAuth, Prisma, and Postgres. It allows for rapid integration of authentication into your applications with minimal configuration. Simply connect your database, run the migration, and you're ready to go!

**Objective**

The objective of this project is to provide a fully customizable authentication solution that allows developers to seamlessly integrate Next.js and NextAuth into their applications. With support for Prisma and Postgres, this project ensures scalable, SQL-based user management while maintaining flexibility in customization. The goal is to reduce the complexity of setting up authentication so that developers can focus on their core features.

## ü§©<a href="quick-start">Quick Start</a>

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Postgres Database](https://www.postgresql.org)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

**Setup**

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ManishZ007/easy-authentication-prisma-postgres.git
cd easy-authentication-prisma-postgres
npm install
```
2. Update the .env file with your Postgres DATABASE_URL:

  if there is not .env file then create one .env file in root
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<database>:<password>@localhost:5432/<collection>"
```
3. Update the .env.local file with your Google OAuth, and GitHub OAuth credentials:

  if there is not .env file then create one .env file in root
```bash
AUTH_SECRET='this automaticaly generate': https://cli.authjs.dev

# github oAuth
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=


# google oAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

4. initialise prisma
```bash
npx prisma init
```

5. adding schema in schema.prisma file
```bash
model users {
  id         String   @id @default(uuid())
  username   String?  @unique @db.VarChar(100)
  email      String?  @unique @db.VarChar(100)
  firstname  String?  @db.VarChar(50)
  lastname   String?  @db.VarChar(50)
  password   String?  @default("null") @db.VarChar(150)
  provider   String?  @default("credentials")
  oauth_id   String?  @default("0")
  created_at DateTime @default(now())
  updated_at DateTime @updatedAt

  @@map("users")
}
```

6. the last step is migrate the prisma into postgres
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration-name>
```

7. Running The Project
```bash
npm run dev
```
